## 2-2 Media

### Types of Media

#### Media propagate(传播) signals that carry bits of information

#### We'll look at some common types:

——Wires （有线）

——Fiber (fiber optics cables 光纤)

——Wireless

### Wires----Twisted Pair（双绞线）

#### Very common;used in LANs and telephone lines

——Twists reduce radiated signal(传播信号)

### Wires----Coaxial Cable（同轴电缆）

#### Also common.Better shielding for better performance

#### Other kinds of wires too

### Fiber

#### Long,thin,pure strands of glass

----Enormous bandwidth(巨大的带宽)(high speed) over long distances

### Two varieties(两种):multi-mode(shorter links,cheaper) and single-mode(up to ~100km)

### Sender radiates（传播） signal over a region

——In many directions,unlike a wire,to potentially(潜在的) many receivers

——Nearby signals(same freq.)interfere at a receiver;need to coordinate use.

#### Microwave，3G，and unlicensed(ISM) frequencies,e.g.,WiFi,are widely used for computer networking
